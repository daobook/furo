"This page lists a few opinionated recommendations for Sphinx plugins to "
"use in your documentation along with Furo. All these plugins work well "
"with Furo-based Sphinx documentation, but they are not inherently tied to"
" Furo."

"This project enables writing documentation with Markdown in Sphinx"
"[^using-markdown]. This is achieved by making well-thought-out extensions"
" to the CommonMark Specification, which make it as capable as "
"reStructuredText. In case you're wondering if that works well... this "
"documentation is written using MyST."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recommendations.md:8
msgid ""
"Markdown is a significantly more popular markup format than "
"reStructuredText. This means that it's likely that potential "
"contributors/developers on the project are significantly more familiar "
"with Markdown than reStructuredText. MyST gives you the best of both "
"worlds -- simplicity and familiarity of Markdown with the extensibility "
"power of reST."

"This project automagically adds Open Graph meta tags to your site's "
"generated HTML. The Open Graph protocol is used by social media websites "
"to determine how to present a page when a link is posted, and by search "
"engines as a criterion toward ranking."

msgid ""
"This project provides a straightforward way to introduce tabbed content "
"within your documentation. This is useful for instructions specific to "
"something about the end user (like their OS, or preferred language, etc)."
" This is a great way to organise complex bits of documentation without "
"major trouble."

msgid ""
"This project provides a live-reloading server, that rebuilds the "
"documentation and refreshes any open pages automatically when changes are"
" saved. This enables a much shorter feedback loop which can help boost "
"productivity when writing documentation. Furo's development workflow is "
"based on [uses this project](contributing/workflow.md#local-development-"
"server)."

"This project adds a convenient copy button to code blocks. This is a "
"subtle but effective user experience improvement when there are code "
"snippets that a user might wish to copy from (examples, sample code etc)."

"MyST addresses all the concerns that have been raised when arguing "
