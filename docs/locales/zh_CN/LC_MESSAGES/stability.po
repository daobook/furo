"Users that aren't using custom templates or undocumented details of Furo "
"should not expect any breaking changes. For everyone else, I won't "
"actively try to break things but that doesn't mean there won't be "
"occasional breakage."

"The \"Reference\" and \"Kitchen Sink\" sections (of Furo's documentation)"

msgid "Undocumented / \"unstable\" customisations"

#: ../../stability.md:29
msgid ""
"Since there is no way to ensure all possible customisations are not "
"affected, Furo makes no promises about them -- notably, there's no "
"stability promise around the exact filenames in the theme templates or "
"theme assets. If you wish to define your own templates or override Furo's"
" assets, it is recommended to be mindful of when you might get a new Furo"
" release and it may make sense to \"pin\" the version of Furo."

msgid "Reasons"
msgstr ""

#: ../../stability.md:33
msgid ""
"Furo was largely motivated by \"I want things to look nicer\", when "
"looking at pip's documentation in early 2021."
msgstr ""

#: ../../stability.md:35
msgid ""
"These stability promises are aimed toward keeping it straightforward for "
"me to maintain and improve this theme going forward. Any additional "
"overhead in keeping the project moving along, would make it less likely "
"that I'd actually continue working on this project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../stability.md:37
msgid ""
"Since this project is \"largely aesthetics\" for nearly all end users, "
"I'd prefer to preserve the contract to just that -- it'll look the same, "
"with minor tweaks expected based on how the Sphinx ecosystem evolves and "
"what I feel should be included in the theme."
